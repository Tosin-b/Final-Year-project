 The project I decided to work on throughout the final semester was a game called Sanio. My project, to its core, was a 2D unity-based game that implemented intelligence to the player using reinforcement learning. The objective of the game was to allow the player to finish the game without any external help.
I decided to do a project based on game development was because I was always intrigued by game development. I thought this project would be most enjoyable to complete. I also thought this project was unique compared to my other classmate's projects.
The essential skills I would like to gain when completing my project are to be a competent c# programmer are to gain skills in Unity and get familiar with machine learning to a stage that can create more complex machine learning-based projects.
The approach of my project was to train my player to play the game and go up every level. He would also try to aim to hit the highest score at each level. I then set a schedule for myself. If I finished my project a month earlier, I would implement reinforcement-learning to my players to learn from them and perform different activities to prevent themselves from dying.
Unfortunately, due to time restraints, I was unable to complete the model.
This project is mainly focused on machine learning since I have no prior experience with it. To train my player, I used an open-source tool kit named ML-agents.
